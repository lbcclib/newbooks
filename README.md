# newbooks
Showcasing our new books using a jekyll site and targeted emails

Email addresses (both of senders and recipients) are defined in
a .env file (not included).  You can select which departments
you'd like to include in _config.yml -- the discipline field
refers to a discipline referenced in the call_number_ranges gem.

To run:
`bundle && bundle exec jekyll build`
