Dear colleagues in the {{ department_name }},

We've recently added some books/materials to our collection that we think you might be interested in:

{% for book in books_of_interest %}
* {{ book.title }}">
{% endfor %}
    
A more complete listing is available at {{ site_url }}.
Please contact Richenda Hawkins (hawkinr@linnbenton.edu)
if you would like us to purchase other materials for our collection.
    
Thanks,
    
LBCC Library
